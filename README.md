# Transmission Reliability Margin algorithm

This project is an open-souce Java package to compute the Transmission Reliability Margin.

This project aims to be a translation in Java code of the [article 22 of the CACM regulation 2015/1222](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32015R1222#d1e2148-24-1).

For more details about the algorithm, please refer to the [detailed documentation](doc/algorithm.md).

This project relies heavily on the [PowSybl environment](https://www.powsybl.org/index.html).

This project provides an API for computing uncertainties as you like ([see documentation for more details](doc/algorithm.md#pipeline-example)).

This API allows for flexibility of usage and partition between algorithm and sensitive data.
